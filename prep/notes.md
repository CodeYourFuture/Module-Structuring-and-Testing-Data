# Notes on `console.log` and `undefined`

## Understanding `console.log` Output in JavaScript

- **Purpose of `console.log`**: `console.log` is a function in JavaScript used to display information in the console. This is helpful for debugging or viewing output as the program runs.

- **Behavior of `console.log`**: 
  - When you use `console.log("hello there!")`, it *prints* `"hello there!"` in the console. However, it does not *return* a value that can be stored or used within the program.
  - If we try to assign the output of `console.log` to a variable, weâ€™ll see that the variable is set to `undefined` instead of `"hello there!"`.

- **Why `undefined` is Returned**:
  - In JavaScript, `console.log` has no return statement. When a function has no return value, JavaScript automatically assigns `undefined` as the result.
  - `undefined` is a unique data type in JavaScript representing "no value." It differs from a blank or empty value, meaning that no value has been assigned.

### Example Code
```javascript
let result = console.log("hello there!");
console.log(result); // Output: undefined

// The .length property is used in programming to determine the number of elements in an array,
 the number of characters in a string, 
 or the size of other data structures depending on the language

 // .padStart padStart(targetLength, padString) This method pads the current string from the beginning (left side)
  until the string's length reaches the target length.
  If the string is already longer than the target length, it does nothing.

  
  // .padEnd padEnd(targetLength, padString)This method pads the current string from the end (right side) until the string's length reaches the target length. 
  Similar to .padStart(), if the string is already longer, it will remain unchanged.

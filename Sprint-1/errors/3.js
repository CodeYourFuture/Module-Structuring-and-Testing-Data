//const cardNumber = 4533787178994213;
//const last4Digits = cardNumber.slice(-4);

// The last4Digits variable should store the last 4 digits of cardNumber
// However, the code isn't working
// Before running the code, make and explain a prediction about why the code won't work
// Then run the code and see what error it gives.
// Consider: Why does it give this error? Is this what I predicted? If not, what's different?
// Then try updating the expression last4Digits is assigned to, in order to get the correct value

///==> my prediction: it won't work because carNumber is neither an array nor a string which means we cannot get the index the way we are doing now
// One way to solve this is:
// 1. Convert carNumber into a string
// 2. subtracts 4 to the length of cardNumber to be able to extract the last 4 elements since we not dealing with and array
const cardNumber = 4533787178994213;
const last4Digits = +cardNumber.toString().slice(- 4);
// console.log(last4Digits)
//explanation
// 1. cardNumber.toString() => convert cardNumber variable into a string
// 2. slice(-4) => get last 4 digits of string cardNumber
// + . convert cardNumber back to a number. ==> I could have use the Number() function to achieve the same

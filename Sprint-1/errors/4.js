const HourClockTime = "20:53";  // Clearly a 24-hour time
const hourClockTime = "08:53";  // Suggests a 12-hour format (AM/PM context implied)

// Definition: A system of timekeeping where the day is divided into two 12-hour periods: AM (Ante Meridiem, before noon) and PM (Post Meridiem, after noon).
// Example: 8:53 PM in 12-hour format is written as 08:53 PM.

// Definition: A system where the day runs from 00:00 (midnight) to 23:59 (one minute before the next midnight), without using AM or PM.
// Example: 20:53 in 24-hour format is 8:53 PM in 12-hour format.
// labels in coding is matters!Why? 
// 1. Consistency in Naming: Helps with understanding the flow of data.
// 2. Avoiding Ambiguity: Mislabeling can lead to incorrect assumptions about the data type or its usage.
// 3. Efficient Communication: When collaborating, meaningful labels reduce the need for excessive comments or explanations.

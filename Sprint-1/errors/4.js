// const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
// const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";

// my prediction

// In the code snippet you provided, the variable name 12HourClockTime starts with a number, which is not allowed in JavaScript.
// Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).

//Hereâ€™s the updated code:

const _12HourClockTime = "20:53";
const _24hourClockTime = "08:53";

// OR ...

const Hour12ClockTime = "20:53";
const hour24ClockTime = "08:53";

//The issue here is that variable names in JavaScript cannot start with a number.


//const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
//const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";

//Rename the variables so they donâ€™t start with numbers. You could use letters at the beginning instead, like this:

const hour12ClockTime = "20:53";
const hour24ClockTime = "08:53";

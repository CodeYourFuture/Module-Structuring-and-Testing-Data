const $12HourClockTime = "20:53";
const $24hourClockTime = "08:53";

// variable names cannot start with numbers, they can only start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign.
// fixed by adding dollar sign before variable.
// 12HourClockTime should only show 12 hours format therefore 20:53 is incorrect.

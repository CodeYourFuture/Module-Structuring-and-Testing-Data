/* In JavaScript, variable names cannot start with a number 
or contain special characters (like :). 
The variable name 12HourClockTime is invalid because it starts with a number. 
Variable names should start with a letter, underscore _, or dollar sign $.  */

// We must Rename the variables so that they are valid: 

const hourClockTime12 = "20:53";
const hourClockTime24 = "08:53";

/*  JavaScript variable names must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). 
They cannot start with a number.
    Renaming 12HourClockTime to hourClockTime12 
and 24hourClockTime to hourClockTime24 resolves the naming issue.  */

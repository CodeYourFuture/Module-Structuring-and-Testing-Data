// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
// const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";


/*
ReferenceError to solve this we have to initialize the cityOfBirth before we access it. */

// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

//The error is because we used the variable cityOfBirth before it was declared.
//in JavaScript we must declare a variable before using it.

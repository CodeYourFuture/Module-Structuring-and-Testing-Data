// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?
function defineCityofBirth() {
    const CityofBirth = "Bolton"; // declaring by let variable and defining CityofBirth ="Bolton"
    console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
    return cityOfBirth = "Bolton"; // return can be used inside the function
}

// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);


/* We got a ReferenceError because can not console.log or cannot access "cityOfBirth" before initialization. That's the reason why we got a ReferenceError */

// This is just an instruction for the first activity - but it is just for human consumption
// We don't want the computer to run these 2 lines - how can we solve this problem?

// We can take an approach called `Commenting`. In different programming languages, there are different ways to solve this.
// And it is just a matter of Syntax. In case of JavaScript for Mac we can do `command + /`
// it means the line is not executed and it is just for sake of reading it.
// So in the case of this exercise I want to comment out the 2 lines (line1 and line2) by selecting both lines and pressing `command + /`

// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

// to run this file we need to go in the root and once we are in the file  run, node 1.js   eg => cd  /Sprint-1/errors  =>  ~ node 1.js


// this line is not working because const does not allow you change the data so we can change to let.
// cost age. = 33; 
// age = age + 1;
// console.log(age);


let age = 33;
age = age + 1;
console.log(age);

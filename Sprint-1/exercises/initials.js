let firstName = "Creola";
let middleName = "Katherine";
let lastName = "Johnson";
// Get the first character of each name using charAt and the index 0
let initials = firstName.charAt(0) + middleName.charAt(0) + lastName.charAt(0); // "CKJ"

// Log the initials to the console
console.log(initials);

// Declare a variable called initials that stores the first character of each string.
// This should produce the string "CKJ", but you must not write the characters C, K, or J in the code of your solution.

console.log(count)
// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// The right side of (=): The expression on the right, count + 1, takes the current value of count, adds 1 to it, and evaluates to a new value. If count was initially 0, count + 1 evaluates to 1.
//(=) Operator (Assignment):The = operator reassigns the result of count + 1 to the variable count. It effectively updates count to store this new value.
//Left Side of = (Variable Being Updated): The variable count on the left of = is where the result is stored, replacing the previous value (in this case, 0 is replaced with 1).

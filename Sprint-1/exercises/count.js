let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// My answer
// We can see that the count variable is incremented by 1 and the new value is assigned back to the count variable in line 3.

let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//Line 3 is reassigning count to become ann adition of its previous value plus one.


// Line 1: Declares a variable count and initializes it with a value of 0.
// Line 3: Performs an increment operation, increasing the value of count by 1. This is achieved by using the expression count = count + 1, where the result of the addition is then reassigned back to the count variable.

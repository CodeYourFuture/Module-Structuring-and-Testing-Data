let count = 0;

count = count + 1; // line 3 takes the current value of count, adds 1 to it, and then assigns the result back to count

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

/*  Line three is a statement. The = operator sign is reassigning the value (count + 1) to the variable .
 
So, line 3 takes the current value of count, adds 1 to it, and then assigns the result (1) back to the count variable, 
updating its value. After line 3 executes, count will be 1.*/

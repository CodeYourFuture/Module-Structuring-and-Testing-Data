let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// answer:
// Here in line 3, we redefine or update the variable count by setting it to add 1 to its value. So, variable count had 0 as its value, then we update it and it gets value 1.

let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

/////////////////////////////////////////////// ANSWER /////////////////////////////////////////////////
// In this task, we have the `+` operator and the `=` assignment operator. The assignment operator takes
// a value on the right side and assigns it to the variable on the left side.
// Initially, the `count` variable is set to `0` in line #1.
// In line #3, we take the current value of `count` (which is 0), add 1 to it using the `+` operator,
// and then assign the result (1) back to the `count` variable.
// This increments the `count` variable by 1, so `count` is now 1.

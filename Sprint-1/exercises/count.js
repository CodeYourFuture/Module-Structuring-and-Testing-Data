let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
console.log(count)

// Explanation of Line 3 (count = count + 1):
// - Assignment (=): The = operator is used to assign a value to a variable. It takes the value on the right-hand side and stores it in the variable on the left-hand side.

// - What Happens in Line 3:

// 1. Right-Hand Side (count + 1): This expression is evaluated first. It takes the current value of count (which is 0 initially) and adds 1 to it. The result of this calculation is 1.
// 2. Assignment: The result (1) is then assigned back to the variable count, updating its value from 0 to 1.

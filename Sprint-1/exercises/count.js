let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// in line 3 the code is adding 1 to the variable count, that is after the line 3 is executed the value of count will now be 1.
// the = operator is used to assign a value to a variable.

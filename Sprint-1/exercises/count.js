let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

/*
Answer:

The = sign here means 'set to' or 'update', it takes the current value
of count and adds 1 to it and set count to this new value .

if count  was 0, it now becomes 1.

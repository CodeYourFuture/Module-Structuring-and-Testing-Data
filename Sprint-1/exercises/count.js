let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// Line 3 is an assignment statement, it is updating the value of the count variable by adding 1 to its current value
// Can also say that line 3 is incrementing the count variable by 1
// Or it is a reassignment statement, updating the value of the count variable
// it can also be written as count += 1; or count++;

let count = 0;

count = count + 1; //count increased by one so addion operaiton is perfomed here.

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

/*  Answer

 The assignment operator(=) is a new value to the variable count.
 This line is taking the current value of count which is 0,and adding 1 to it, and then reassigning the result back to count.

  steps:-
  count=count+1;// reading the current value of count
  count=0+1;// addint 1 to count
  count=1;// reassigning the result back to count

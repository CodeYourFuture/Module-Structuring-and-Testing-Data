// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

/* Line 3 is an assignment statement being used to increment a counter. 
The = is assignment operator, which assigns the outcome of the expression on its right hand side 
to the variable to on the left hand side. In this code snippet, the value of the variable counter will assume 1 after line 3

Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
What is the return value of `prompt`?

**\*** Answer:
prompt function will display a input box with a text input field and two buttons, which is labeled ok and cancel and request the user to enter the name in this case.
If the user enters their name, for example Amir and clicks Ok, then myName will store Amir.
If the user clicks Cancel or closes the prompt, myName will store null.

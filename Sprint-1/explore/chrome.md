Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
What is the return value of `prompt`?

A: return value of using the prompt function is pop up message
A: well when i enter const myName = prompt("What is your name?"); it gives a pop-up message at the top of my browser asking me my name. i use the return like alert myName to display the myName variable

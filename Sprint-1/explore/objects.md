## Objects

In this activity, we'll explore some additional concepts that you'll encounter in more depth later on in the course.

Open the Chrome devtools Console, type in `console.log` and then hit enter

What output do you get?
- I get : f log() {[native node]} and when I use typeof(console.log) I get : function

Now enter just `console` in the Console, what output do you get back?
- I get a variety of functions that go with console object
Try also entering `typeof console`
- I get that console is an object

Answer the following questions:

What does `console` store?
- Console doesn't store values instead it writes something but doesn't save it anywhere permanent. Console is great to check thing while one is working
What does the syntax `console.log` or `console.assert` mean? In particular, what does the `.` mean?
- The syntax means that console.log is a built-in function that allows users to output messages or values to the console.
- The "." is known as the "dot operator" or "property access dot notation". It is specifically used as the syntax for accessing an object's properties directly

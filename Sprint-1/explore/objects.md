## Objects

In this activity, we'll explore some additional concepts that you'll encounter in more depth later on in the course.

Open the Chrome devtools Console, type in `console.log` and then hit enter

What output do you get?
I a text with function letter (f) log() {[native code]}. I believe the f letter indicates that it is a function 

Now enter just `console` in the Console, what output do you get back?
I have a list of other functions such as debug, error, info, log, warn

Try also entering `typeof console`
it says an object

Answer the following questions:

What does `console` store?
it stores various functions to return information, errors, warns
What does the syntax `console.log` or `console.assert` mean? In particular, what does the `.` mean?
There are specific ways, methods to access the object which is console. The dot allows to access specific methods of an object. So log s a method within a console and assert is assert method.

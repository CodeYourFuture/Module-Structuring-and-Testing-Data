## Objects

In this activity, we'll explore some additional concepts that you'll encounter in more depth later on in the course.

Open the Chrome devtools Console, type in `console.log` and then hit enter

What output do you get?

Now enter just `console` in the Console, what output do you get back?

Try also entering `typeof console`

Answer the following questions:

What does `console` store?
What does the syntax `console.log` or `console.assert` mean? In particular, what does the `.` mean?

<!-- console.log shows the definition of the function console.log -->
<!-- console shows the properties and methods stored under console e.g. debug, error, info etc.  -->
<!-- typeof console returns object, this means console is stored as an object in javascript -->
<!-- console is the object, log and assert are methods within console, console.log therefore means access log function inside of console and console.assert means access assert inside of console. The "." is the member access operator, it is used to access the properties or methods within an object. -->

## Objects

In this activity, we'll explore some additional concepts that you'll encounter in more depth later on in the course.

Open the Chrome devtools Console, type in `console.log` and then hit enter

What output do you get? It doesnâ€™t produce any output, because I haven't invoked the function.

Now enter just `console` in the Console, what output do you get back? console by itself outputs the console object, showing all its methods and properties.

Try also entering `typeof console`

Answer the following questions:

What does `console` store? console stores an object that provides methods for logging information, debugging, and interacting with the developer console.
What does the syntax `console.log` or `console.assert` mean? In particular, what does the `.` mean? console.log or console.assert use dot notation. The . symbol accesses a property or method of the object to the left of it (console). Here, log and assert are methods (or functions) within the console object.

// This program takes a string representing a price in pence
// The program then builds up a string representing the price in pounds

// You need to do a step-by-step breakdown of each line in this program
// Try and describe the purpose / rationale behind each step

// To begin, we can start with
// 1. const penceString = "399p": initialises a string variable with the value "399p"
//2. removes P at the end of the 399P to show the numerical part of the string.
//3.Pads the string to ensure it's at least 3 digits long
//4. Extracts the pounds part (the first digit) from the string "3" from "399"
//5.Extracts the pence part (last two digits) and ensures it's always 2 digits long.
//6. Prints it in a format with symbols pounds and pence.

const movieLength = 8784; // length of movie in seconds

const remainingSeconds = movieLength % 60;
const totalMinutes = (movieLength - remainingSeconds) / 60;

const remainingMinutes = totalMinutes % 60;
const totalHours = (totalMinutes - remainingMinutes) / 60;

const result = `${totalHours}:${remainingMinutes}:${remainingSeconds}`;
console.log(result);

// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program? => There are six variable declarations in this program:
// - Line 1: movieLength
// - Line 3: remainingSeconds
// - Line 4: totalMinutes
// - Line 6: remainingMinutes
// - Line 7: totalHours
// - Line 9: result 

// b) How many function calls are there? => There is only one function call in this program:
// - Line 10: console.log(result)

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer

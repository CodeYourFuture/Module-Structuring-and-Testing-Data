const movieLength = 8784; // length of movie in seconds

const remainingSeconds = movieLength % 60;
const totalMinutes = (movieLength - remainingSeconds) / 60;

const remainingMinutes = totalMinutes % 60;
const totalHours = (totalMinutes - remainingMinutes) / 60;

// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?
// There are 6 variable declarations.

// b) How many function calls are there?
// There is one function call.

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators
// The expression movieLength % 60 devides the movieLength by 60 seconds and return the reminder 
// which will be stroed in the const remainingSeconds.

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?
// Firstly, Removes the leftover seconds from movieLength and then converts the remaining seconds 
// into whole minutes which will be stored into totalMinutes.

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?
// The variable result reprents the movieLength in hours:minutes:seconds. The variable should be renamed by totalDuration.

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer
// I have tried with 3 variables, 1515, 9999 & 70052. I observed that this code works succesfully with all the values
// and gave me results for all the different movieLength in hours:minutes:seconds.

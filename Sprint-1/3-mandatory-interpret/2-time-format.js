const movieLength = 8784; // length of movie in seconds

const remainingSeconds = movieLength % 60;
const totalMinutes = (movieLength - remainingSeconds) / 60;

const remainingMinutes = totalMinutes % 60;
const totalHours = (totalMinutes - remainingMinutes) / 60;

// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?
// There are 6 variable declarations.

// b) How many function calls are there?
// There is 1 function call, which is console.log(result).

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators
// % is Remainder operator. In this case, movieLength % 60 gives us the number of seconds 
// that are left after we have taken out all the full minutes from the movie length.

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?
// calculates the total number of minutes in the movie length,
// excluding the remaining seconds that are less than a full minute.

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?
// The variable result represents the formatted time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
// A better name for this variable could be movieFormattedTime.

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer
// This code will work for all non-negative integer values of movieLength.
// However, if movieLength is a negative number, the result will be weird format with negative numbers.
// Moreover, if movieLength is not an integer, the result will also be weird format with decimal numbers.

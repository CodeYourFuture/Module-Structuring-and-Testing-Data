const movieLength = 3600; // length of movie in seconds

const remainingSeconds = movieLength % 60;
const totalMinutes = (movieLength - remainingSeconds) / 60;

const remainingMinutes = totalMinutes % 60;
const totalHours = (totalMinutes - remainingMinutes) / 60;

const result = `${totalHours}:${remainingMinutes}:${remainingSeconds}`;
console.log(result);

// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?

// b) How many function calls are there?

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer

// ANSWER
// A : Totally 6

// B: Just 1 , console.log(result);

// C: % is a remainder operator. It gives the remainder when movieLength is divided by 60.

// D: How many minutes are in this movie.

// E: It shows the time of movie in this style :--->   HH:MM:SS   Name :-->  formattedTime/ formattedMovieLength

//F: Yes it works, I tried different movie length in seconds.

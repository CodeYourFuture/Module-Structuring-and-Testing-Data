// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?

// b) How many function calls are there?

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer


// a)6
// b)1
// c)remainder operator; we get a reminder after devision 8784/60. remainder is 24
// d) we take length of the movie in seconds, subtract remainder and turn this value into minutes.
// e)it represents timing in hours, min, sec. Better way to call result could be 'formattedTime'.
// f) its continue to work as expected with different values.

// Read the code and then answer the questions below

// a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made
//there are 5 function calls, line 4 has 2 function calls Number() and replaceAll(), line 5 has 2 function calls Number() and replaceAll(), line 10 has a log() function call.

// b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem? line 5 there was a missing comma separating the two arguments for the replaceAll function.

// c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statements lines 4 and 5.

// d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations. lines 1,2,7 and 8

// e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression? it is taking the carPrice variable and removing the comma from it then converting it to a number.

// Read the code and then answer the questions below

// a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made

// b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem?

// c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statements

// d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations

// e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression?

//There are two function calls in the file. They are:

//a. carPrice.replaceAll(",", "") – This calls the replaceAll() method to remove commas from the carPrice string.
//priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", "") – This also calls the replaceAll() method to remove commas from the priceAfterOneYear string.

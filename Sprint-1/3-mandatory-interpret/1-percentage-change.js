console.log(`The percentage change is ${percentageChange}`);

// Read the code and then answer the questions below

/*
a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made
*/
// There are 5 function calls in this file. They are:
// Line 4:
//   carPrice.replaceAll(",", "") → Calls the replaceAll() method on the carPrice string.
//   Number(...) → Converts the result to a number using the Number() function.
// Line 6:
//   priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", "") → Calls the replaceAll() method on priceAfterOneYear.
//   Number(...) → Converts the result to a number using the Number() function.
// Line 11:
//   console.log(...) → Calls the log() function to print to the console.

/*
b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem?
*/
// The error occurs on Line 5:
// priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll("," ""));
// because the replaceAll() method is missing a comma between its two arguments. It should be:
// priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", "")
// The fix is to add the comma between the arguments to make it syntactically correct.

/*
c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statements
*/
// The variables carPrice and priceAfterOneYear are reassigned on lines 4, 5, and 6:
// carPrice = Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", "")); // Line 4
// priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", "")); // Line 5 (assuming fixed)
// priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", "")); // Line 6
// These lines update the existing variables by converting their string values (with commas) into numbers without commas.

/*
d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations
*/
// The variable declarations happen on the following lines:
// Line 1: let carPrice = "10,000";
// Line 2: let priceAfterOneYear = "8,543";
// Line 8: const priceDifference = carPrice - priceAfterOneYear;
// Line 9: const percentageChange = (priceDifference / carPrice) * 100;
// So, there are 4 variable declarations in total.

/*
e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression?
*/
// The expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", "")) performs two tasks:
// 1. carPrice.replaceAll(",", ""): This removes all commas from the carPrice string.
//    For example, if carPrice = "10,000", this part of the expression turns it into "10000".
// 2. Number(...): This then converts the cleaned string "10000" into a number: 10000.
// This expression is used to convert a string that looks like a number with commas (like "10,000") into an actual number (10000) so that it can be used in mathematical calculations.

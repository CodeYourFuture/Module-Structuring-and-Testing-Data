let carPrice = "10,000";
let priceAfterOneYear = "8,543";

carPrice = Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", ""));
priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll("," ""));

const priceDifference = carPrice - priceAfterOneYear;
const percentageChange = (priceDifference / carPrice) * 100;

console.log(`The percentage change is ${percentageChange}`);

// Read the code and then answer the questions below

// a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made
//    There are 5 function calls in this file.
//    Lines with function calls:
//    - carPrice = Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", "")); // replaceAll() and Number()
//    - priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", "")); // replaceAll() and Number()
//    - console.log(`The percentage change is ${percentageChange}`); // console.log()

// b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem?
//    The error is coming from the line: `priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll("," ""));`
//    The error occurs because there is a missing comma between the two arguments in the `replaceAll()` method: `(",", "")`. It should be `replaceAll(",", "")`.
//    To fix this, add a comma between the empty string and the comma character within the `replaceAll` function call, like so: `priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", "")`.

// c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statements
//    - carPrice = Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", ""));
//    - priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", ""));

// d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations
//    - let carPrice = "10,000";
//    - let priceAfterOneYear = "8,543";
//    - const priceDifference = carPrice - priceAfterOneYear;
//    - const percentageChange = (priceDifference / carPrice) * 100;

// e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression?
//    This expression is performing two main operations:
//    1. `carPrice.replaceAll(",", "")`: This part of the expression is called on the `carPrice` string ("10,000"). The `replaceAll()` method is used to remove all occurrences of the comma (",") character from the string. After this operation, "10,000" becomes "10000".
//    2. `Number(...)`: This part then takes the resulting string ("10000") and converts it into a numerical data type.
//    The purpose of this entire expression is to convert the string representation of a price, which includes a comma for readability, into a pure numerical value that can be used for mathematical calculations (like subtraction and division to find the difference and percentage change).

let carPrice = "10,000";
let priceAfterOneYear = "8,543";

carPrice = Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", ""));
priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", ""));

const priceDifference = carPrice - priceAfterOneYear;
const percentageChange = (priceDifference / carPrice) * 100;

console.log(`The percentage change is ${percentageChange}`);

// Read the code and then answer the questions below

// a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made

// b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem?

// c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statements

// d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations

// e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression?

// ANSWER :

// A: totally 7 times:
// 2 times replaceAll()  ,  2 times Number() , 1 time console.log

// B: Missing comma between 2 arguments of replaceAll () function

// C:
// carPrice = Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", ""));
// priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", ""));

// D:
// let carPrice = "10,000";
// let priceAfterOneYear = "8,543";
// const priceDifference = carPrice - priceAfterOneYear;
// const percentageChange = (priceDifference / carPrice) * 100;

//E: At first it remove the comma and then convert it to Integer

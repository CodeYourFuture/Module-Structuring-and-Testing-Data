// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
/*
 line Three increases the value of count by 1.
The `=` sign here is the assignment operator, not a comparison.
It takes the value on the right-hand side (count + 1)
and stores it back into the count variable on the left.

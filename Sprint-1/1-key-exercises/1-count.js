let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// SOLUTION:
// Line 3 is updating the value of the count by adding 1 to its value.
// line 3 uses the assignment operator which is = and while count increases by one, increment stores additional 1 to the count variable.

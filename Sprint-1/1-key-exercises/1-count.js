let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// In this code variable is declare as count = 0,  expression increments the value of count by 1 and variable count is updated to be count + 1.


//An expression is any valid unit of code that have value. In this code , we have different types of expressions:
// Assignment, arithmetic and compound assignment.
// An operand is a value or variable that an operator acts upon in an expression.

//count = 0	(Assignment	count) 
//count + 1	(Arithmetic	count) 
//count = count + 1	(Compound Assignment)

// count 0 =
//count 1 =
// count + 1 = (this is operand) all this (=, + and = are operator)
// So in this code count = 0 is an assignment expression because it assigns a value (0) to the variable count.
//The = operator is the assignment operator.

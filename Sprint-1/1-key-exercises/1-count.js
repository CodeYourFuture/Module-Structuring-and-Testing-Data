let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular, focus on what = is doing


//The answers:
//  In line 1, the variable `count` is declared and initialised with the value `0`.  
//  In line 3, the value of `count` is updated by assigning it the result of `count + 1`. Since the initial value was `0`, the new value becomes `0 + 1`, which is `1`.  

//  In programming terms, this means the variable `count` is incremented by `1`.  

//  The equals sign (`=`) is the assignment operator. It assigns the value on the right side of the `=` to the variable on the left side.

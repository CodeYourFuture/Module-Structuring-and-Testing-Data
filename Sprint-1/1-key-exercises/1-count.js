let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

/*
 Answer: in line 3, the variable count gets reassigned a new value which is the sum of the old value and 1.
In other words, the variable count is now adding 1 to its old value to obtain a new value.

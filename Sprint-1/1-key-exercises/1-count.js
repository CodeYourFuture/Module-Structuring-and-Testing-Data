let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// is assignment it takes the variable vlue, which is 0 and add 1.
// // Since count was initially 0, this becomes: count = 0 + 1, so count now holds the value 1.

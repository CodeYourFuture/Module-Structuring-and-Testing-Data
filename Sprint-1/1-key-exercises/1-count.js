// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
/* count + 1 is evaluated. This takes the current value of count (which is 0) and adds 1 to it, resulting in 1.
The result of the addition (1) is then assigned to the variable count. This overwrites the previous value of count (which was 0) with the new value (1).

So, after line 3 is executed, the variable count will hold the value 1.

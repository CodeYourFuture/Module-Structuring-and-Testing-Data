let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing


//The = symbol is the assignment operator. It assigns a value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.
//In this case, the new value of count is determined by the expression count + 1.

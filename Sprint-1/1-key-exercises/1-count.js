let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// Line 3 is (incrementing variable 'count' by 1) i.e updating the value of the count variable by adding 1 to its current value.
// The = (assignment) operator is used to assign the new value (count + 1) back to the count variable.
// Meaning, 'count' variable now has a new value of 1.
console.log(count); // outputs 1

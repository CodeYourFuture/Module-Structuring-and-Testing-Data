let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Line 3 is updating the value of the variable count by increasing it by 1.
// The = operator assigns the value on the right (count + 1) to the variable on the left (count).

console.log(count); // Output: 1

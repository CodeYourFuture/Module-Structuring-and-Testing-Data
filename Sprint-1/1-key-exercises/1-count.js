let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// line 3 is updating the value of the count variable by adding 1 to its current value. The = operator is used for assignment, meaning it takes the value on the right (count + 1) and assigns it to the variable on the left (count).

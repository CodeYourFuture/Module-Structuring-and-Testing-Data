let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 is reassigning the value of count, its current value 0 plus 1, after line 3 the value of count is 1. The = operator is assigning the new value to the count variable.

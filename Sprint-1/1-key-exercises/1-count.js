let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
// This line is updating the value of the count variable by increasing it by 1
=======
// “Store the value on the right-hand side into the variable on the left-hand side.”
// "Take the current value of count, add 1, and then store the result back in count."

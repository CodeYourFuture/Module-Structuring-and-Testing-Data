let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// In line three count is a constant variable but since we can not reassign constant variables we will use let here,
//  We want to reassigning count to whatever the count value was before in this case 0 and we want to add 1 to that value meaning => 0 + 1 = 1.

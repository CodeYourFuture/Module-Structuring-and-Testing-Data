let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
/*
In line 3, there is an expression. It performs 2 different action. 
    Once is assignment a new value to variable of count. = is an operator which is used for assignment. 
    Second is count + 1 means add one to existing value.
The meaning of line 3 is "Assign count plus 1 to count variable." so new value is 0+1=1

let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3:
// count + 1 => 1 is added to whatever value is currently in count
// count was initialised with a value of 0, so has a type of number
// performing the addition should not be an issue
// the = takes the result of count + 1 and stores it in count

let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// The = operator updates the value of count by assigning it a new value so count is not =0 anymore it is = to 1

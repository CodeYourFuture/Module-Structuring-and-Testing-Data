let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

//Q: Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
//Q: Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
/* Line 3 is updating the value of the count variable by adding 1 to its current value. The = operator is used for assignment, 
meaning it takes the result of the expression on the right (count + 1) and assigns it to the variable on the left (count).
The expression count + 1 evaluates to the current value of count (which is 0) plus 1, resulting in 1, which is then assigned back to count.*/
// The final value of count is 1
console.log(count); // Output: 1
// The console.log statement outputs the current value of count to the console, which is now 1 after the update.
// The final value of count is 1

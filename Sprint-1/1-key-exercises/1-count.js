let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 reassigns the count variable by evaluating the expression on the right hand side of the assignment.
// The right hand side (count + 1) is evaluated first, then the = operator assigns that value to count.

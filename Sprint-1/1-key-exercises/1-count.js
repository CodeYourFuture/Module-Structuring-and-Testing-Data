let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// Line 3 is updating the value of the count variable by adding 1 to its current value
// The = operator is used to assign a new value to the count variable, which is the result of the expression count + 1
// This means that the current value of count is being incremented by 1
// After this line executes, the value of count will be 1

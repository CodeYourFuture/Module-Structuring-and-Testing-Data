let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 increases the value of the variable count by 1.
// The = sign means we are assigning the new value (count + 1) back to the same variable.
// First, it calculates the right side, then stores the result in count.

let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//Answer :
//Since the variable declaration is let on line 1, line 3 is declaring a new value for the variable count by changing it's value to count + 1.
//The = sign is declaring the value of a variable in both of these instances.

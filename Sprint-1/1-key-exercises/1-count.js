let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
//In line 3 we are taking the current value of count (which is 0) and adding 1 to it, and store the new value back into  count" so now count is 1.the = is an assignment operator that Assigns values to variables so it takes the value on the right side (count + 1) and assigns it to the variable on the left side (count).

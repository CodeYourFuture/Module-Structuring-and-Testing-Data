let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// line 3 is trying to asign a new value to variable count by adding the value of count that is equal to 0 and adding 
// 1 to it. The = assigns value to the variable.

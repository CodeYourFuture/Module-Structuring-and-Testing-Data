let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// It increases the value of variable count by 1. This is called incrementing.
// = is the assignment operator. It takes the value on the right hand side and store it in the variable on the left hand side
// After the execution of line 3 the value of count becomes 1.

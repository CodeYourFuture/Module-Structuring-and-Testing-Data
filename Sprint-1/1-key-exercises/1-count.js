let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 increments count by adding +1. After line 3, count will equal 1. The = sign assigns a new value to a variable.

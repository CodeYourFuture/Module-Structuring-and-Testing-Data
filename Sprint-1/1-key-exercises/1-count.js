let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 is updating the value of the count variable by adding 1 to its current value. The = operator is an assignment operator that assigns the result of the expression on the right (count + 1) to the variable on the left (count).
// So after line 3 executes, count will have a new value of 1.
// = does not mean “equal to” (as in math); it means “take the value on the right and store it in the variable on the left.”

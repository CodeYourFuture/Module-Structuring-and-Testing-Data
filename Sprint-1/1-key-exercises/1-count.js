let count = 0;

count = count + 1;


// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

    // ANSWER

    //Line 3 is reassigning a new number to the variable 'count',
    // and = is  the assignment operator changing the value of the variable count adding one number to it.

let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//In the Line 3 we can see that using the equal symbol '=' a new value is been assigned to the variable 'count'. 
// Specifically the new value assigned is the previous value plus 1. Due to the previous value was 0 now is 1.

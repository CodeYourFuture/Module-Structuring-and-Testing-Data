let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Explanation: In Line 3, the '=' is reassigning the 'count' variable to the current value of 'count' plus 1 i.e. incrementing 'count' by 1.

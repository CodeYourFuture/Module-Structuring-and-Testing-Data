let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 reassigns the 'count' variable. It evaluates the right side first (0 + 1 = 1)
// and then assigns that result back into the count variable.
// The count variable is often used to keep track of the number of iterations or occurrences in a loop or process.

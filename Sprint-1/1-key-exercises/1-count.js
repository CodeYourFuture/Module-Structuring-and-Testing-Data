let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

Line 3 is like telling, take the current value of count, add 1 to it and then store that new value back in count.

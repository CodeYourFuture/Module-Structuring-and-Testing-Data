let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// We are updating the previous value of count to a new value. The = operator assigns a new value 
// to the variable, meaning the data stored in memory is being changed.

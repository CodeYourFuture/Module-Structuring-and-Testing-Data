let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
//In line 3 we are adding 1 in count value and reassign this value to count again. so initial point count =0 but at line 3 it will be 1

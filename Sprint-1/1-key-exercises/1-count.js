let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Line 3 is an assignment statement. The = is the assignment operator, which takes the value on the right side (count + 1, which evaluates to 1) and assigns it to the variable on the left side (count), updating count's value from 0 to 1

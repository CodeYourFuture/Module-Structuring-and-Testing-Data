let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 is updating the value of the count variable by incrementing its current value by 1.
//   =  sign is an assignment operator that transfers its value on the right (count + 1) to the variable on the left (count).

let count = 0;

count = count + 1; // This line is incrementing (adding) 1 to the current value of 'count' variable then updating the result back to 'count'.

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

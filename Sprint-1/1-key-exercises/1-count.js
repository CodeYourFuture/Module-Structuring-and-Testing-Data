let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 is updating the value (count)
//The left-hand side (count) is the variable being assigned a value,while = is the assignment operation.
//The = operator assigns the new value (1) to the count variable, replacing the old value (0).
//Now, count stores 1

let count = 5;

count = count + 1;

console.log(count);

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

/* Answer: In line 3, count = count + 1;, the = operator is performing an assignment. 
It takes the current value of the variable count, which is 0 at this point, 
adds 1 to it, and then assigns the result back to the variable count.
So, after this line executes, count will now hold the value of 1. 
Essentially, this line increments the value of count by 1 */

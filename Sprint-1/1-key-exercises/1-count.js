let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//Line 3, count = count + 1;, is an assignment statement that updates the value of the count variable. Specifically, it:

//1.Takes the current value of count (which is 0 initially).
//2.Adds 1 to it, resulting in 1.
//3.Assigns this new value (1) back to the count variable.
//4.The = operator in this context is the assignment operator. 
//5. It takes the value computed on the right side of the equation (count + 1) and stores it in the variable on the left side (count), overwriting its previous value. 
// 6.effectively increments the count variable by 1.

let count = 0;

count = count + 3;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 is updating the value of the count variable by adding 1 to its current value. The = operator 
// is used to assign the new value (count + 1) back to the count variable.
// we can also say that the = operator is taking the value on the right side (count + 1) and storing it 
// in the variable on the left side (count).

// We can see the result of our code by logging the count variable to the console
console.log(count);

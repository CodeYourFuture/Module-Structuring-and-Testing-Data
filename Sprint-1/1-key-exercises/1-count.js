let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//Answer
//Line 3 shows adding 1 to count which was declared and assigned in line 1 which is 0 and assign the result of this operation to count so count will be updated/increment by 1 and equal to 0+1=>1
// = is an assignment operator used to assign value to a variable in this case we are assigning the value of 0+1 or 1 to count. so count will be 1.

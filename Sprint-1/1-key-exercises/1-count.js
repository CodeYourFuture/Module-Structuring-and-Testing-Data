let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
//= in JavaScript is the assignment operator, which is used to assign a value to a variable. In this case it's resigning the value of count to 1.

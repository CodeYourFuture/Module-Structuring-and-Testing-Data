let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// line 3 increases the value of count by 1.
// the "=" operator assigns the  result of "count + 1" back to the variable count.

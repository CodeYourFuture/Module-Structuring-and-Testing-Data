let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular, focus on what = is doing


//The answers:
//In line 1, the declared value is set to 0. In line 3, the value is redefined and set to count + 1. So the initial count value was 0, and the new value is 0 + 1. 
//In programming terms, the value of count increments by 1. 
//The equal sign is an assignment operation. It assigns the value on the right side of the = to the variable on the left side.

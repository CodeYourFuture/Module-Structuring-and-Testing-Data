let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

console.log(count); // should print 1

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing


// On line 3, the code `count = count + 1;` updates the value of the variable `count`. JavaScript first takes the current value stored in `count`, adds `1` to it, and then assigns the new result back into the same variable.
// The `=` symbol here is the **assignment operator**. It does not mean “equals” in mathematics. Instead, it means “take the value on the right-hand side and store it in the variable on the left-hand side.”
// After this line runs, `count` now contains the value `1` instead of `0`.

let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//This line (line 3) increments the variable counter to 1.

//"=" does not mean "equal" as in math (in math = means equation, and in programming it means assignment).
//The "=" operator takes the value on the right (count + 1) and stores it in the variable count.
//This overwrites the old value of count. 

//conclusions:
//The line count = count + 1;:

//Takes the old value of count, adds 1 and stores it back into count.
//The = operator updates the variable with the new value.

//I found the Equivalent for count = count + 1. It is count += 1 or count++.

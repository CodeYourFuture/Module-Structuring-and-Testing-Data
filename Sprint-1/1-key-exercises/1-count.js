let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// Line 3 is updating the value of the count variable by adding 1 to its current value. 
// The = operator is used for assignment, meaning it takes the value on the right (count + 1) 
// and assigns it to the variable on the left (count).
// The expression count + 1 calculates the new value, and the = operator updates 
// the count variable with this new value.
// The final value of the count variable is now 1.

let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// count is the name of the variable. count is not a constant variable and can be changed and updated because of the way it is declared using let. The initial value of count is set to 0. From line 3, the = operator is used to assign a new value to the count variable. The expression count + 1 calculates the current value of count (which is 0) and adds 1 to it, resulting in a new value of 1. This new value is then assigned back to the count variable, effectively updating its value from 0 to 1.

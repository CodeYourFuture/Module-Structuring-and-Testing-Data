let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
//Line 3 is doing: - its reads the current value of count (which is 0), 
// then it adds 1 to that value (0 + 1 = 1)
// then, it reassigns that result (1) back into count variable.
// The = symbol is the assignment operator, Take the value on the right side, and store it into the variable on the left side.

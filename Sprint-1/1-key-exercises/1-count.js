// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//line 3 has two parts, the right side is (count+1). Javascript will evaluate this expression first.
//it will look up the current value of the count variable which is assigned as 0 and add 1 to 
//it. This will update the count to 1.


// The left side of the expression takes the result from right hand side and assign the value to
//the variable count.
// = is an assignment operator. It updates the variable on the left with the value of expression on the right.

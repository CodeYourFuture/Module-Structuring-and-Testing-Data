let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular what=
Line one shows the initial value is 0 as a variable Declaration,
Line 3  on the right-hand side count + 1 is evaluated first which means the current value 0 adds 1, giving 1
The left-hand side count= means: Assign the result of right-hand side 1 back into the variable
count. So after this runs the output should be 1

let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// This line 3 is updating the value of count by adding 1 .
// The = symbol is the assignment operator in JavaScript.
// It assigns a new value to the variable on the left side.
// In this case, it means: set the value of count to the result of count + 1.
// Since count was initially 0, this becomes: count = 0 + 1, so count now holds the value 1.

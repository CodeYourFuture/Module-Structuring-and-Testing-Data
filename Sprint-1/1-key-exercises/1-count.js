let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// Line 3 updates the value of the variable count by increasing it by 1. The expression on the right side of the = adds 1 to the current value of count, and the result is then stored back into count. The = symbol is an assignment operator. It takes the value on the right-hand side and assigns it to the variable on the left-hand side. In this case, it means take the result of count + 1 and assign it to count. = does not mean equality, like in mathematics; it means assignment in programming.

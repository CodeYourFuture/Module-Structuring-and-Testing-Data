let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing


/*
 the (=) sign is the assignment operator,
 It assigns the result of count + 1 (which is 1) back to the variable count

 After execution, the count variable now holds the value 1

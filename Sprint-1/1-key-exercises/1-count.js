let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
//Line 3 is  updating the value of count. Therefore, line 3 is just increasing the value of count by 1.


//RESPONSE VELOW
Line 3: count = count + 1;
This line updates the value of the count variable by increasing it by 1.

The = in this line is the assignment operator, not a comparison operator. It assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.

So count + 1 is evaluated first (which gives 1, since count was 0).

Then the result (1) is assigned back to the variable count.

So overall, Line 3 means:
“Take the current value of count, add 1 to it, and store the new value back in count.”

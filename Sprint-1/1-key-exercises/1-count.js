let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// The = sign means assignment. It takes whatever is on the right side, works it out, and then stores that result into a variable on the left. So count = count + 1 means take the current value of count, add 1, and then save that back into count.

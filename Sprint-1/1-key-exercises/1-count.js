let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing


// Answer: In line 3 we are redeclaring the variable count to count + 1, this will add the value in count by 1
//            ' = ' this is the assignment operator it is assigning the values to the variable count

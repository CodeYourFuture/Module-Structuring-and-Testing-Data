let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

console.log(count); // Output: 1
// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// Line 3 is incrementing the value of the count variable by adding 1 to its current value. 
// The `=` operator is used for assignment, it assigns values to variables. 
// In this case, it takes the current value of `count` (which is 0) and adds 1 to it, resulting in a new value of 1, which is then stored back in the `count` variable.

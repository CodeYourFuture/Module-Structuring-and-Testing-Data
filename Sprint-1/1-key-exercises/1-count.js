let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// 1 is added to the value of count. the = takes the value of 'count + 1' and assigns it to count

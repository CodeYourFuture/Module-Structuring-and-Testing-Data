let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
//Line 3 is doing: - count = count + 1; is incrementing the value of the count variable. 
//This operation reads the current value of count, adds 1 to it, and then reassigns the new value back to count. 
// The = symbol is the assignment operator, Take the value on the right side, and store it into the variable on the left side.

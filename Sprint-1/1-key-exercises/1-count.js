let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

/* 
    Solution:
  Line 3 updates the value of the variable `count` by adding 1 to its current value.

  ➤ `count + 1` → This evaluates to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.
  ➤ The assignment operator (`=`) takes the result of `count + 1` and assigns it back to the variable `count`.
  ➤ So now, `count` holds the new value: `1`.

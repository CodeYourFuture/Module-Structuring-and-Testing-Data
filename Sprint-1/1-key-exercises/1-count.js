let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// Line 3 is taking the current value of the variable count, by adding 1 to it, and then using the = to assign the result back to the same variable - count.

let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// Line 3 takes the current value of count (0), adds 1 to it, and assigns the result (1) back to count.
// The = operator is used for assignment â€” it sets the variable to a new value.

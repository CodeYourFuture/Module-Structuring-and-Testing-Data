let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// Line 3 is updating the value of the count variable by adding 1 to its current value. The = operator is used for assignment, it assigns values to variables. In this case, it takes the current value of count (which is 0) and adds 1 to it, resulting in a new value of 1 for count.

const minimum = 1;
const maximum = 100;

const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * (maximum - minimum + 1)) + minimum;
console.log(num);

// In this exercise, you will need to work out what num represents?
// Try breaking down the expression and using documentation to explain what it means
// It will help to think about the order in which expressions are evaluated
// Try logging the value of num and running the program several times to build an idea of what the program is doing
// Math.floor() method always rounds down and returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number
// Math.random() method returns a floating-point pseudo-random number in the range 0 to less than 1

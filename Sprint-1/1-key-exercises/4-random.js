const minimum = 1;

/* The floor method rounds decimal numbers down to the nearest smaller integer.
The random method generates a decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
In JavaScript, operations inside parentheses are evaluated first.
In this code, we first generate a number using the random method.
Then, we subtract the minimum from the maximum defined above and add 1.
After that, we multiply the number generated by the random method with this result.
Next, we round it down to the nearest smaller integer using the floor method.
Finally, we add the minimum to this result and assign the value obtained to a variable named num */

// In this exercise, you will need to work out what num represents?
// Try breaking down the expression and using documentation to explain what it means
// It will help to think about the order in which expressions are evaluated
// Try logging the value of num and running the program several times to build an idea of what the program is doing

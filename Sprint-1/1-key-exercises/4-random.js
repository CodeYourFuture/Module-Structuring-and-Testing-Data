const minimum = 1;
const maximum = 100;
const num = 2;

const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * (maximum - minimum + 1)) + minimum;

// In this exercise, you will need to work out what num represents?
// Try breaking down the expression and using documentation to explain what it means
// It will help to think about the order in which expressions are evaluated
// Try logging the value of num and running the program several times to build an idea of what the program is doing



// SOLUTION:

// In this program, variable num is assigned to a value between 1 and 100.

// In 5th line, expressions of math.floor and math.random are used to generate a random number between the minimum and maximum numbers that are defined by first const minimum= 1 and second const maximum = 100.

// Also math.floor is used to round down the random number generated by math random to get to the nearest whole number.

const minimum = 1;
const maximum = 100;

const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * (maximum - minimum + 1)) + minimum;
console.log(num);
console.log(num);



// In this exercise, you will need to work out what num represents?
// Try breaking down the expression and using documentation to explain what it means
// It will help to think about the order in which expressions are evaluated
// Try logging the value of num and running the program several times to build an idea of what the program is doing

/*Assignment Expressions:
minimum = 1
maximum = 100
const num = ...

Function Call Expressions:
Math.random()
Math.floor(...)
console.log(num)

Arithmetic Expressions:
(maximum - minimum + 1) (subtraction and addition)
Math.random() * (maximum - minimum + 1) (multiplication)
Math.floor(...) + minimum (addition)


When you log several time it will so different value.
 Math.random gives u the value if decimal number is higher than 0.5 than the output will round up or less than 0.5 will rounds down. for example: 5.95 will be 6, 5.34 output will be 5 and -4.6 will be -5.

In the other hand Math.floor() function rounds a number down to the nearest integer, always moving towards negative infinity.
for example: 5.95 will be 5 and -4.1 output will be -5.

What is the significance of (maximum - minimum + 1)? What does this expression represent?
This expression represents (maximum - minimum + 1) is used to adjust the range of values generated by the random number, ensuring that the range is inclusive of both the minimum and maximum values.
Math.random() * (100 - 1 + 1) Generates a value between 0 and 100 (exclusive)
Math.floor(Math.random() * (100 - 1 + 1)) Generates a value between 0 and 99 (inclusive)
to get maximum we use +1.

What is the significance of ... + minimum?
The ... + minimum part of the expression is crucial because it shifts the generated random number to ensure that the range starts at the minimum value rather than at 0.
Math.floor(Math.random() * (100 - 1 + 1)) + 1 it will be from 1 to 100 and without Math.floor(Math.random() * (100 - 1 + 1)) will be 0 to 99.

What is the range of values that could be assigned to num?
The value will be range between 1 to 100.

To test your understanding, how would you write an expression (without using any variable in the expression) that can yield a random integer between -5 and 5 (including both -5 and 5)?
Math.floor(Math.random() * 11) - 5
To generate a random integer between -5 and 5 (inclusive), we need 11 possible integer values. */

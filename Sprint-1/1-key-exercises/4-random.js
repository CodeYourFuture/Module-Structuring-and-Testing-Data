// In this exercise, you will need to work out what num represents?
// Try breaking down the expression and using documentation to explain what it means
// It will help to think about the order in which expressions are evaluated
// Try logging the value of num and running the program several times to build an idea of what the program is doing


// The variable `num` represents a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

// Here's how it works:
// 1. Math.random() generates a decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
// 2. (maximum - minimum + 1) gives the range of possible values. In this case: 100 - 1 + 1 = 100.
// 3. Math.random() * 100 gives a decimal between 0 and 99.999...
// 4. Math.floor(...) rounds that number down to the nearest whole number (0 to 99).
// 5. Adding `minimum` (1) shifts the range to 1â€“100.

// So, each time we run the program, `num` will be a different integer between 1 and 100.

const minimum = 1;
const maximum = 100;
const num = 2;

const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * (maximum - minimum + 1)) + minimum;

// In this exercise, you will need to work out what num represents?
// Try breaking down the expression and using documentation to explain what it means
// It will help to think about the order in which expressions are evaluated
// Try logging the value of num and running the program several times to build an idea of what the program is doing



// SOLUTION:

// num represents a random number between the minimum and maximum values.

// program is designed for num to return random numbers between 1-100.

//expressions of math.floor and math.random are there for //generating a random number between the minimum and maximum values and then rounding it down to the nearest whole number...

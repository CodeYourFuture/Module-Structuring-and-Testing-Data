//  Every time you run that code, num will be a different integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
// [Running] node "d:\CYF\Module-Structuring-and-Testing-Data\Sprint-1\1-key-exercises\4-random.js"

// In this exercise, you will need to work out what num represents?
// Try breaking down the expression and using documentation to explain what it means
// It will help to think about the order in which expressions are evaluated
// Try logging the value of num and running the program several times to build an idea of what the program is doing

let firstName = "Creola";
let middleName = "Katherine";
let lastName = "Johnson";

// Declare a variable called initials that stores the first character of each string.
// This should produce the string "CKJ", but you must not write the characters C, K, or J in the code of your solution.

let initials = firstName[0] + middleName[0] + lastName[0];
console.log(initials)
// fistName[0] gets the first character of the string "Creola" C
// middleName[0] gets the second character of the name "Katherine" K
// lastName[0] gets the third character of the name "Johnson" J

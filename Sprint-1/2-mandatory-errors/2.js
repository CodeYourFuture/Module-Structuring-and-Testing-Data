// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
// the error is because you are trying to execute the code without first declaring the variable.
// so the declaration comes first then execution comes after.

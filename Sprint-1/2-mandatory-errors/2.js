// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);


// the variable 'cityOfBirth' had to be declared first before doing the console log.
// This is because the JAvascript reads from top to bottom

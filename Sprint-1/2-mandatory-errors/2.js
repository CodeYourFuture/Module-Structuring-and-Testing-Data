// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ? 
//                  const was declared after using it , we have to declare a variable first and then use it.

// console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
// const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

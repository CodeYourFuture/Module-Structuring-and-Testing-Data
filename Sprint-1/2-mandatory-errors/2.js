// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

// console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
// const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

//Sam
//Prediction : The computer is running the line 4 before it is running line 5
//We need to declare variable first before it can be printed as output

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

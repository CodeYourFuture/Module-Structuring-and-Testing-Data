// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

//The error is “Cannot access ‘cityOfBirth’ before initialisation”
//There is an error because we are trying to use the variable’ cityOfBirth’ before it is declared.
// To resolve the error, we need to declare the variable before using it.

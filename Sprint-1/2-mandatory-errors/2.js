// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";


// Code is executed line by line so the variable cityOfBirth is not defined when it is called in the console.log line.

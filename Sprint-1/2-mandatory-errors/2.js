// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?
// we should put variable declaration first then print out as JS languages rules, can not write the other way around

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

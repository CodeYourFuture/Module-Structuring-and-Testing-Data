// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?


const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

//ANSWER

// In this code we are declaring the variable after the console.log, which is Javascript executes the code line by line that is 
// why we are getting a reference error.

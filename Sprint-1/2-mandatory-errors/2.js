// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

// The error message 'Cannot access 'cityOfBirth' before initialization' occured because the 'const' variable was used before it was declared.

// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

// When the message was tried to be printed the system couldn't access to 'cityOfBirth'
// The declaration of the const cityOfBirth must be done before.

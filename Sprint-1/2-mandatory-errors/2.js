// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

// The variable cityOfBirth was called before it was defined, so we need to bring that variable first 
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

// Problem fixed

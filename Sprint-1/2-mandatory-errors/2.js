// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

//it's not working because variable cityOfBirth was not defined.
//change the position of -- const cityOfBirth = "Bolton"; -- before the logging will fix the problem

// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

//Error is in the sequence of the program. When the program executes first line the variable 'cityOfBirth' is not defined.
// this error can be removed by logging the string after the variable declaration.

//console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

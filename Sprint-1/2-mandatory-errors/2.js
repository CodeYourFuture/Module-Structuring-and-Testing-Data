// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?


const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

// explanation: the error was that the variable cityOfBirth was not defined before it was used in the console.log statement.

// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

// You need to declare the variable before you use it. Code should look like this:
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

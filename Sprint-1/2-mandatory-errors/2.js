// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

//console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
//const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
// The error occurs because 'cityOfBirth' is used before it is declared.
// To fix this, we can declare 'cityOfBirth' before using it in the console.log statement.
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`); // Output: I was born in Bolton
// Now the code works correctly and prints the expected output.

/* 
This happens because in JavaScript, variables declared with `let` or `const` are not accessible before their declaration 
due to a behavior called the **temporal dead zone**. 
If you try to use such a variable before itâ€™s initialized, you get a `ReferenceError`. 
To avoid this, always declare and assign your variables before using them.

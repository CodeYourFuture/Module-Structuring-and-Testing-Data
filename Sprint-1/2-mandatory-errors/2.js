// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

//The error was const cityOfBirth put after the console.log which is wrong. You need first to declare the variable and define it then run the code using console.log.

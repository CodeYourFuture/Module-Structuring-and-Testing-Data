// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

// We need to declare the cityOfBirth variable before the call it. When we move the declaration of cityOfBirth before the printing it will work.

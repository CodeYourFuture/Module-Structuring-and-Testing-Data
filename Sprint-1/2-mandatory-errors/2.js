// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

// The variable was being called before it was declared. Moved the declaration of
// the variable to the top to fix the error.

// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

// the variable 'cityOfBirth' had to be declared first before doing the console log.
// This is because the JAvascript reads from top to bottom

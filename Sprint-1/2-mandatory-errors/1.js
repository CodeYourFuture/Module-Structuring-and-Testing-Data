// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

//const age = 33;

// we need to replace "const" with "let", in javascript "const" is usd for variable
// that will nor change / will be kept constant troughout the code, where is "let"
// lets us to reassign variable later as we have done in the lines below the variabel age
// gets updated by one... 

let age = 33;
age = age + 1;


console.log(age);

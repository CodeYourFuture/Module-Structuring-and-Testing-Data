// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

const age = 33;
age = age + 1;
console.log(age); // Output: 34
// The code above declares a variable age with an initial value of 33.
// It then reassigns the value of age by adding 1 to its current value, so the declaration must be using 'let' keyword.

// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

const age = 33; //we need to change const to let. 
age = age + 1;

let age2 = 33;
age2 = age2 + 1;
console.log (age2);

//or we can use const age but add another variable 

const age3 = 33; 
let age4 = age3 + 1;
console.log (age4);

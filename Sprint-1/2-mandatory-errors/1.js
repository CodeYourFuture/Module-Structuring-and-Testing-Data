// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

const age = 33;
age = age + 1;

// in the case above will throw an error because we are trying to reassign a value to a constant variable.

let age2 = 33;
age2 = age2 + 1;

// this is the correct way to reassign a value to a variable.

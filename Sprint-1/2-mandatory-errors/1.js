// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

const age = 33;
age = age + 1;

// Error: The variable const for the "age" value can not be reassigned
// const means "constant" once assigned, it can not be changed.
// to fix this error, we use "let" instead of "const" to declare the age variable.

// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

let age = 33;
age = age + 1;
console.log(age);

// Changed const to let because the variables value need to change during the program. const creates a fixed reference that cannot be reassigned. but let allows updating the variable which is required when incrementing or modifying values.

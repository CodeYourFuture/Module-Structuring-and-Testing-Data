// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

let age = 33;
age = age + 1;

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
console.log(age); // Output: 34
=======

// const = A constant reference to a value, Cannot be reassigned to a new value. Good for values that should not change (like configuration, functions, etc.)
// let = A block-scoped variable that can be reassigned. Useful when the value is expected to change.

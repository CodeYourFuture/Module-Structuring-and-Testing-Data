// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

// const age = 33;
// age = age + 1;

//Sam
//The given code was incorrect because we have declared the variable as const.The value stored within const variable cannot be reassigned
//To fix this we can declare value with let variable instead :

let age = 33;
age = age + 1;
console.log(age);

// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

const age = 33;
age = age + 1;
//the "age" variable has been declared with a const and already assigned a value and it can not 
// be reassigned another value because of the "const"
// "age" should be declared with "let"  to be able to change it's value

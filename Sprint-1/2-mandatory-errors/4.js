//const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
//const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";

//no clear instructions in this js, but 20:53 is 24hr clock and 08:53 could be 12hr clock.
//first character of variable name can't be numbers

//fix:
const twentyfourHourClockTime = "20:53";
const twelveHourClockTime = "08:53";

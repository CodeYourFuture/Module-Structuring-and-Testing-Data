// This code snippet demonstrates the use of a 12-hour clock time and a 24-hour clock time.
// The 12-hour clock time is represented as "08:53 PM" and the 24-hour clock time as "20:53".
// The 12-hour clock time is a common format used in many countries, while the 24-hour clock time is often used in military and scientific contexts.
// An identifier or a keyword should not start with a number, so the variable names are chosen accordingly.
const time24HourClock = "20:53";
const time12hourClock = "08:53 PM";
// The following code will print the 12-hour clock time and the 24-hour clock time
console.log(`The 12-hour clock time is ${time12hourClock}`);
console.log(`The 24-hour clock time is ${time24HourClock}`);

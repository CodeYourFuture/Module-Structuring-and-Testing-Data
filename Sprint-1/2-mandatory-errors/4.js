//Sam
// console.log(12HourClockTime);
// console.log(24hourClockTime);
//Following error was received
// const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
//       ^^

// SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token

const _12HourClockTime = "20:53";
const _24hourClockTime = "08:53";
console.log(_12HourClockTime);
console.log(_24hourClockTime);

//Conclusion :
//When declaring a variable the identifier shouldn't start with numbers. It has to always start with letter or have an underscore before a letter foran expressionx to be correctly processed

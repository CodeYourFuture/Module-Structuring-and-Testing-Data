//const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
//const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";

//Answer
//The above code starts with a number and javascript naming does not allow that.
// Also the naming is not camel case since H is in Uppercase not lowercase
/*const hourClockTime12 = "20:53";
const hourClockTime24 = "08:53";
console.log(hourClockTime12);
console.log(hourClockTime24);
*/

//Correction
const hourClockTime24 = "20:53";
const hourClockTime12 = "08:53";
console.log(hourClockTime24);
console.log(hourClockTime12);

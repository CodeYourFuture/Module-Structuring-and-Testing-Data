const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";


const hour12ClockTime = "20:53 PM";
const hour24ClockTime = "08:53";
console.log(hour12ClockTime);
console.log(hour24ClockTime);
it gave a SyntaxError: Identifier directly after number, which mean a variable starting with a number, which is not allowed in js.

const 12HourClockTime = "20:53"; //js does nott allow variable names to start with a number
const 24hourClockTime = "08:53"; //it is better to use the number in the middle or at the end of the variable name.
//example:
const clockTime12Hour = "20:53"; //this is a valid variable name
const clockTime24Hour = "08:53"; //this is also a valid variable name

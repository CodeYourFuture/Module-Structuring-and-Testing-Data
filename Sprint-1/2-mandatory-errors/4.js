const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";


Answer:

// The first line is wrong cuz variable names can't start with a number.
// We should rename it like hour12ClockTime or something that doesn't start with a digit.
const hour12ClockTime = "20:53";
const hour24ClockTime = "08:53";

const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";

// cost 12HourClockTime = "20.53" is wrong code because 20 is more than 12 and variable name can not start with digital in JavaScript.
// The right coe should be:

const TwelveHourClockTime = "8:53"
const TwentyFourHourClockTime = "20:53"

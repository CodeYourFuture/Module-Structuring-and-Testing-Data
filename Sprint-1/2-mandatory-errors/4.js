Javascript does not allow variable names to start with a number. Therefore the two variable names are invalid and they throw a syntax error that points to the numbers in the variable names.
Also the times don't match the suggested clock types, i.e 20:53 is not a 12 hour clock time, it is a 24 hour clock time, and 08:53 is not a 24 hour clock time, it is a 12 hour clock time.

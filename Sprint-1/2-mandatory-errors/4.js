const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";

//Variable names in JavaScript cannot start with a number.
// so we have to change 12 to twelve and 24 to twentyFour 

const twelveHourClockTime = "08:53";   // 12-hour time (8:53 AM)
const twentyFourHourClockTime = "20:53"; // 24-hour time (8:53 PM)

// we can also put it this way:

const clock12 = "08:53";
const clock24 = "20:53";

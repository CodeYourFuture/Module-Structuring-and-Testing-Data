const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";



/*
1. when running the code i got these error: SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
2. and that is because variables names have rules which are:
            1. variable names can not start with a number 
            2. variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscore and dollar sign 
            3. variable names can not be a reserved keyword
on this code the variable name is starting with a number so the fixed would be 
            const twelveHourClockTime = "20:53";
            const twentyFourhourClockTime = "08:53";

//const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
//const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";


// problem is in javascript we cant start a variable name with a number.

// correct way is:

const twelveHourClockTime = "20:53";
const twentyFourHourClockTime = "08:53";

console.log(`The time in 12-hour format is ${twelveHourClockTime} and in 24-hour format is ${twentyFourHourClockTime}`);

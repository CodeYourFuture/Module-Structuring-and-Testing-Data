const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";// variable name can not start with a number
const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";// variable name can't start with a number 

// to correct this code i have to begin the variable name with either letter or underscore character 

clockTime12Hour="20:53"// even though "20:53" is not in 12 hour format our code will run as long as the variable is defined 
clockTime24Hour="08:53"

const twelveHourClockTime = "20:53";
const twentyFourHourClockTime = "08:53";



/*   
    ERROR DEBUGGING

    const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
    const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";

                      My Prediction:
    The variable names `12HourClockTime` and `24hourClockTime` start with digits, 
    which is not allowed in JavaScript variable names. Variable names must begin 
    with a letter, underscore `_`, or dollar sign `$`.

    So, I predict the code will throw a SyntaxError like:
        → SyntaxError

                     What I Got:
    → SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token

                    Explanation:
    JavaScript does not allow variable names to begin with a number. 
    When you try to declare a variable like `const 12HourClockTime`, 
    JavaScript throws a SyntaxError because it's invalid syntax.

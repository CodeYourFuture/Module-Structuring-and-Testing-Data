const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";
//Problem:
//Variable names in JavaScript cannot start with a number.
// The variable 12HourClockTime is invalid and will cause a syntax error.

//Solution:
//Rename the variables so they start with letters (e.g., spell out the numbers or use more descriptive names).
//Fixed Code:
const twelveHourClockTime = "08:53";
const twentyFourHourClockTime = "20:53";
//Explanation:

//The string values are valid representations of time.

//The only issue was the variable name starting with a number.

//The fixed variable names follow JavaScript naming rules.

const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";

// syntax error: java script does not allow variable names to start with a number as in above examples: "12HourClockTime", "24hoursClockTime".
// The value does not match in both 24hour and 12hour formats.
// Solution: move the numbers after the words or spell the  numbers out.
// the  variables should be named like this: const hourClockTime12 = "08:53";, const hourClockTime24 = "20:53";.
// Or like spell the  number  out: const twelveHourClockTime = "08:53"; , const twentyFourHourClockTime = "20:53";.

// Problem Case (invalid syntax):
// const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";  // ❌ SyntaxError: Invalid variable name
// const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";  // ❌ Also invalid (starts with number)

// Solution:
const twelveHourClockTime = "08:53";  // ✅ Valid (starts with letter)
const twentyFourHourClockTime = "20:53";  // ✅ Valid

/* Explanation:
1. JavaScript variable naming rules:
   - Cannot start with a digit (0-9)
   - Must start with letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($)
   
2. Fix approach:
   - Changed numeric prefixes to words ("twelve" instead of 12)
   - Maintained clear, descriptive names
   - Kept the same time values as strings

3. Why strings are appropriate:
   - Time formats with colons are best represented as strings
   - No arithmetic operations needed on these values

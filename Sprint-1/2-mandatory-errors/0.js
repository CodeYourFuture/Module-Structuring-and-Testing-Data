This is just an instruction for the first activity - but it is just for human consumption
We don't want the computer to run these 2 lines - how can we solve this problem? 

/* 
I got "SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier" error message. It happen because the 2 lines don't make sense.
the computor sees the first word and it assumes a variable or a function is being declared but then when 
it reads the resut of the sentence it breaks as this is not how an identifier is being used and formed in 
a programme.
To avoid this issue, we can just simply comment the 2 lines, just like what I am doing here!

// This is just an instruction for the first activity - but it is just for human consumption
// We don't want the computer to run these 2 lines - how can we solve this problem?

/** If you have lines that are just instructions or notes for humans and you don’t want the computer to execute them, you can turn them into comments.

In JavaScript, there are two ways to write comments:

1. Single-line comment

Use // at the start of a line.
Everything after // is ignored by the computer.

Example:

// This line explains what the code does
const num = 8;

2. Multi-line comment

Use \ /* ... *\ / to wrap several lines.

Example:
This section is just instructions
The computer will ignore everything between these symbols

const num = 5;

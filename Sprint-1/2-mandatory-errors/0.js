// This is just an instruction for the first activity - but it is just for human consumption
// We don't want the computer to run these 2 lines - how can we solve this problem?

/** The lines that are just instructions or notes for humans and we don’t want the computer to execute them, we turn them into comments.

In JavaScript, there are two ways to write comments:

1. Single-line comment

Use // at the start of a line.
Everything after // is ignored by the computer.

Example:

// This line explains what the code does
const num = 8;

2. Multi-line comment

Use slash asterisk at beginning and asterisk slash at end to wrap several lines.

Example:
The comment wrapping this explanation

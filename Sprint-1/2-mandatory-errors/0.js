// This is just an instruction for the first activity - but it is just for human consumption
// We don't want the computer to run these 2 lines - how can we solve this problem?

// Interpretation:
// The error "SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'is'" means that JavaScript found the word "is", but it didn’t make sense in that position. 
// It wasn’t valid code that JavaScript could understand.

// Why the error occurred:
// The error occurred because the sentence was written as plain text instead of a comment.
// To fix it, the sentence should be written as a comment (by adding // at the beginning) so that JavaScript ignores it.

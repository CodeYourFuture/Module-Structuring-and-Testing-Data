## 1 Exercises

In this section, you'll have a short program and task. Some of the syntax may be unfamiliar - in this case, you'll need to look things up in documentation.

## 2 Errors

In this section, you'll need to go to each file in `errors` directory and run the file with node to check what the error is. Your task is to interpret the error message and explain why it occurs. The [errors documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors) will help you figure out the solution.

## 3 Interpret

In these tasks, you have to interpret a slightly larger program with some syntax / operators / functions that may be unfamiliar.

You must use documentation to make sense of anything unfamiliar - learning how to look things up this way is a fundamental part of being a developer!

You can also use `console.log` to check the value of different variables in the code.

## 4 Explore - Stretch ðŸ’ª

This stretch activity will get you to start exploring new concepts and environments by yourself. It will do so by prompting you to reflect on some questions.

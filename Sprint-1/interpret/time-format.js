const movieLength = 60; // length of movie in seconds

const remainingSeconds = movieLength % 60;
const totalMinutes = (movieLength - remainingSeconds) / 60;

const remainingMinutes = totalMinutes % 60;
const totalHours = (totalMinutes - remainingMinutes) / 60;

const result = `${totalHours}:${remainingMinutes}:${remainingSeconds}`;
console.log(result);

// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?

// There are 6 variable declarations in this program

// b) How many function calls are there?

// 1 function call which is console.log()

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents
//  The  remainder (%) operator returns a remainder when one operand divides by second operand. In this case it returns remaining seconds.

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?
// In order to find the total Minutes, we subtract the total length of the movie in seconds from the remaining seconds and then divide it by 60.

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?

//The result represent the length of the movie  in hours, minutes and in seconds. The name Running_Time would be better variable name as it highlights the lengthOfFilm

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer

// yes it will work with all interger but not with floating point value as the seconds will not be whole numbers. Also negative values while it works should not be accepted as film running time. Also strings will not work as well.

## Objects

In this activity, we'll explore some additional concepts that you'll encounter in more depth later on in the course.

Open the Chrome devtools Console, type in `console.log` and then hit enter

What output do you get? we get the outline of the function for console.log

Now enter just `console` in the Console, what output do you get back? we get the console object and can view all its properties or methods associated with it.

Try also entering `typeof console`

Answer the following questions:

What does `console` store? console is an object that stores functions
What does the syntax `console.log` or `console.assert` mean? In particular, what does the `.` mean?
the `.` is a way of accessing the properties of the console object, which in the case of console.log is the log function and in the case of console.assert its the assert function.

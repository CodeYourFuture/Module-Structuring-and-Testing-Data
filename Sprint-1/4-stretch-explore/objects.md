## Objects

In this activity, we'll explore some additional concepts that you'll encounter in more depth later on in the course.

Open the Chrome devtools Console, type in `console.log` and then hit enter

What output do you get?  
// # ƒ log() { [native code] }

Now enter just `console` in the Console, what output do you get back?
// # console {debug: ƒ, error: ƒ, info: ƒ, log: ƒ, warn: ƒ, …}

Try also entering `typeof console`
// # "object"

Answer the following questions:

What does `console` store?
// # function methods.

What does the syntax `console.log` or `console.assert` mean? In particular, what does the `.` mean?
// # It means that `console` is an object, and `log` or `assert`
are methods of that object.

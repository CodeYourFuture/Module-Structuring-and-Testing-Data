My ansers come form AI as i dintn't undestand the excercise but now I know :

What does console store?
console stores an object. This object contains various properties, many of which are functions (also known as methods when they belong to an object). These functions provide utilities for debugging and logging information to the developer console.

What does the syntax console.log or console.assert mean? 
In particular, what does the . mean?
The syntax console.log or console.assert means you are accessing a property (in this case, a function) of the console object.

The . (dot) is called the property accessor or member access operator. It is used to access properties or methods that belong to an object. In simple terms, it means "look inside this object for something named..."

So, console.log means "access the log function that is a part of the console object."

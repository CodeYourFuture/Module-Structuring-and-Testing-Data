## Objects

In this activity, we'll explore some additional concepts that you'll encounter in more depth later on in the course.

Open the Chrome devtools Console, type in `console.log` and then hit enter

What output do you get?
// The 'console.log' as it is appears but with a single qoute.


Now enter just `console` in the Console, what output do you get back?
// 'console' is the output.

Try also entering `typeof console`
//'typeof console' is the output backticks are changed to single quotes.

Answer the following questions:

What does `console` store?
// console stores a collection of functions to output.
What does the syntax `console.log` or `console.assert` mean? In particular, what does the `.` mean?
// `.` means that read what is inside as a string not as a function. So instead of expecting an output from `console.log` we expect it to be executed as it is as a string.

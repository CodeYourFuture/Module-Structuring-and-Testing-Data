## Objects

In this activity, we'll explore some additional concepts that you'll encounter in more depth later on in the course.

Open the Chrome devtools Console, type in `console.log` and then hit enter

What output do you get?
ƒ log() { [native code] }

Now enter just `console` in the Console, what output do you get back?
console {debug: ƒ, error: ƒ, info: ƒ, log: ƒ, warn: ƒ, …}

Try also entering `typeof console` = object

Answer the following questions:

What does `console` store?
it does'nt store your data or variables it simply provides methods to output information.
What does the syntax `console.log` or `console.assert` mean? In particular, what does the `.` mean?
console.log = Access the log function from the console
console.assert = Access the assert function from console
('.') the dot = access a property or method from an object

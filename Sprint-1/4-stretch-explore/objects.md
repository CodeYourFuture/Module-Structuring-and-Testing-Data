## Objects

In this activity, we'll explore some additional concepts that you'll encounter in more depth later on in the course.

Open the Chrome devtools Console, type in `console.log` and then hit enter

What output do you get?
//f log() { [native code] }

Now enter just `console` in the Console, what output do you get back?
//It gave me a list of functions like dropdowns like assert, clear, context, count etc

Try also entering `typeof console`
//it gave me 'object' as an answer
Answer the following questions:

What does `console` store?
//From chatgpt 'console is an object in JavaScript that provides debugging and logging functions. The output shows the properties and methods available within the console object.'
What does the syntax `console.log` or `console.assert` mean? In particular, what does the `.` mean?
//Again, from chat gpt Both console.log and console.assert use dot notation (.), which is a way to access properties or methods of an object in JavaScript.

Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?
<!-- it shows a popup msg with this text:Hello world! -->

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
<!-- It ask user to enter a name with a popup msg -->

What is the return value of `prompt`?
<!-- If I print it, it shows the text that user entered -->


<!-- alert("Hi")
let Name=prompt("Enter your name please: ")
alert(name) -->

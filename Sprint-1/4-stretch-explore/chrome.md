Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
What is the return value of `prompt`?
/*
1. What effect does calling the `alert` function have? in console when i type alert("Hello World!"); and enter. I got a prompt on screen saying Hello World" and at right side bottom there is ok button. If I clicked on ok prompt disappear.

2. const myName= prompt("What is your name?"); and enter then command prompt appear with a question and an input section and two button ok and cancel. in input I can give any input and hit ok. and same input which I gave will print on console as a return value. If i hit cancel it return null.

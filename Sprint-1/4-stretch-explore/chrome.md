Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?

A small popup box appears with the message ("Hello world!") and an OK button

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
What is the return value of `prompt`?

When you call prompt("What is your name?"):
A dialog box appears with your message and an input field.
If you type text and click "OK" 
prompt() returns the exact string you entered.

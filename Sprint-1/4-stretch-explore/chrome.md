Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?
//A message that says Hello World pops up on the top of the page.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
//A message saying what is your name with a box to write your name in pops up.

What is the return value of `prompt`?
//A message saying my name is with a box to write your name in pops up on the top of the page.

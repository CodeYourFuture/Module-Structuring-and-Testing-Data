Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
What is the return value of `prompt`?

I wrote this code in Console.
let myName = prompt("What is your name?");
alert("Hello "+myName);
Then, browser asked me my name and said Hello Hakan
prompt is a function for interaction with user and return the value of user entry.
When the user clicks Cancel, the prompt() function returns null.

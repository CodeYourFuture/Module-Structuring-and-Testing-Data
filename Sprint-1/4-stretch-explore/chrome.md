Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?
    it will trigger an alert box that says "Hello world!" on the page.

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` - store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
    it will trigger a dialog box with a message and an input field 

What is the return value of `prompt`?
    if we entered a value on the input field and pressed ok the value we enterned will retun 
    if we didnt enter a value or we press cancel the value will be null

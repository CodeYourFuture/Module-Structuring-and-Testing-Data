# 🧭 Guide to week 3 exercises

## 🐛 Debug

First off, `format-as-12-hours.js` has a 🐛.

a) Write an assertion to check the output of `formatAs12HourClock` when it is called with an input `"17:42"`
b) Check the assertion output and try to explain what the bug is

You'll need to go back and look at some of the functions you implemented in week 2 - write down some assertions to check the functions:

- Write some assertions down for the function

## 🧹 Refactor

In these problems, you'll be _given_ an implementation and then asked to change it. Once you've updated the implementations you'll need to double check that they are still working!

## 🔧 Implement

In the `implement` directory you've got a number of functions you'll need to implement.
For each function, you also have a number of different cases you'll need to check for your function.

Use the acceptance criteria as an aid to **_write assertions_** for the different cases using `console.assert`. Use your assertions to check the functionality you're building as you go along.

Here is a recommended order:

1. `get-angle-type.js`
1. `is-proper-fraction.js`
1. `get-card-value.js`
1. `is-valid-triangle.js`

## 💪 Stretch

Implement `rotateChar` as defined in `implement/rotate-char`

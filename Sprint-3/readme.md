## ðŸ”§ Implement

In the `implement` directory you've got a number of functions you'll need to implement.
For each function, you also have a number of different cases you'll need to check for your function.

Use the acceptance criteria as an aid to **_write tests_** for the different cases using Jest. Use your assertions to check the functionality you're building as you go along. Make sure you cover all edge-cases.

Here is a recommended order:

1. `get-angle-type.js`
1. `is-proper-fraction.js`
1. `get-card-value.js`
1. `is-valid-triangle.js`
1. `implement/rotate-char`

// There is an implementation of format-as-12-hours.js in the debug directory
// This implementation currently uses the expression Number(time.slice(0, 2)) twice
// Store this expression in a variable and reference it twice in the function in the correct place

// Explain why it makes more sense to store this expression in a variable

/* Testing criteria - to determine that the input is a proper fraction, true or false
The input will consist of 2 numbers, numerator and denominator:
If either the numerator or denominator is zero, it must be converted to absolute values.
If the numerator is small than the denominator, it is a proper fraction: true
If the numerator is larger than the denominator it is not a proper fraction: false
If the denominator is 0, it should throw an error: "Denominator cannot be zero"
If the numerator is 0, it should throw an error: "Numerator cannot be zero"
If the numerator is equal to the denominator, it is not a proper fraction: false

## **PROJECT: Credit Card Validator**

In this project you'll write a script that validates whether or not a credit card number is valid.

Here are the rules for a valid number:

- Number must be 16 digits, all of them must be numbers.
- You must have at least two different digits represented (all of the digits cannot be the same).
- The final digit must be even.
- The sum of all the digits must be greater than 16.

For example, the following credit card numbers are valid:

```markdown
9999777788880000
6666666666661666
```

And the following credit card numbers are invalid:

```markdown
a92332119c011112 (invalid characters)
4444444444444444 (only one type of number)
1111111111111110 (sum less than 16)
6666666666666661 (odd final number)
```

These are the requirements your project needs to fulfill:

- Make a JavaScript file with a name that describes its contents.
- Create a function with a descriptive name which makes it clear what the function does. The function should take one argument, the credit card number to validate.
- Write at least 2 comments that explain to others what a line of code is meant to do.
- Return a boolean from the function to indicate whether the credit card number is valid.

Good luck!


//Answer: Breakdown
touch command to create file cardValidator.js
define a function cardValidator(cardNumber16digits){}
// this function checks if the card number entered by a user is valid.
// a valid card number has the following parameters: 16 digits, ends in even number so use %2 if ==0 then even, if cardNumber sum > 16 card is valid.
function ends in return boolean if card is valid(true) or invalid(false) */



function cardValidator(cardNumber){
    // this function checks if the card number entered by a user is valid.
    // a valid card number has the following parameters: 16 digits, ends in even number so use %2 if ==0 then even, if cardNumber sum > 16 card is valid.
    // a conditional statement to say if the cardNumber is true or false
    return validCard //this is a true or false to show if the card is valid

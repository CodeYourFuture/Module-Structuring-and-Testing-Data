## Changelist

This Pull Request includes JavaScript exercises where I learned about identifying and fixing errors. 

I improved my skills in creating new branches, committing individual files, and committing all changes at once. I also prefer using command-line commands rather than buttons for these tasks. 

I used String.prototype.padStart() for the first time and gained a good understanding of its usefulness.

To view changes instantly, I used nodemon with a command (while true; do nodemon $(ls *.js | fzf); done) for interactive, real-time feedback.

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> write your answer here
// pad will be called 3 times (once for hours, once for minutes, once for seconds).

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
// The first call is pad(totalHours). For input 61, totalHours is 0.

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
// pad(0) returns "00".

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
// The last call is pad(remainingSeconds). For input 61, remainingSeconds is 1.

// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
// pad(1) returns "01".

// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> pad is called 3 times â€” once for hours, once for minutes, and once for seconds.


// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> pad is first called for total hourse which is 0 hours

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// =============> the return value is "00"

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> pad is called for total seconds at last time which is 1 seconds.

// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> the return value is "01".It pads "1" with a leading zero to ensure two digits.

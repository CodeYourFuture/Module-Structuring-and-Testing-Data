// You will need to play computer with this example - use the Python Visualiser https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// pad will be called 3 times

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// The value assigned to num when pad is called for the first 
// time is 0 (the value of totalHours). 

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// The return value of pad when it is called for the first time is "00" 
// because 0 is padded with a leading zero.

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
//The value assigned to num when pad is called for the 
// last time is 1 (the value of remainingSeconds). 
// This is because the return statement is executed from left to right, so the order of pad calls is: totalHours, remainingMinutes, and finally remainingSeconds.



// e) What is the return value of pad when it is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
//The return value of pad when it is called for the last time is "01" because 1 is padded with a leading zero.

// The final output of formatTimeDisplay(61) will be "00:01:01".

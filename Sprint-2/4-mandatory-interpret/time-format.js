// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> 3 times â€” once for hours, once for minutes, and once for seconds.

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> First time `pad` is called is with `totalHours`, which is 0. So `num = 0`.

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// =============> `pad(0)` returns `"00"` because it converts 0 to a string and pads it to two characters.

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> The last time `pad` is called is with `remainingSeconds`, which is `1` (since 61 % 60 = 1). So `num = 1`. This happens after calculating how many seconds are left over.

// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> `pad(1)` returns `"01"`. This is because `1` is converted to the string `"1"`, and then `.padStart(2, "0")` adds a zero in front to make it two digits.

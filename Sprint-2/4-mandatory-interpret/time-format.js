// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> write your answer here
// formatTimeDisplay  was called in line 13, and pad has been called three times

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
// pad(0) returns "00" because it converts 0 to string and pads it to length 2
// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
//it was the total totalHours if this was the parameter   

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
// The value was the remainingSeconds which is 1 if it's the parameter. Each time that is called it takes a value and process it in the function and return that function as a value 

// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
// The return value is "01" â€” the number 1 is converted to a string and padded with a leading zero using padStart(2, "0").

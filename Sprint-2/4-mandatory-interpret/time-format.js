// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> 3

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> the value is totalHours which equals to (totalMinutes - remainingMinutes) / 60

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// =============> 16

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> 1

// e) What is the return value of pad when it is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> 01

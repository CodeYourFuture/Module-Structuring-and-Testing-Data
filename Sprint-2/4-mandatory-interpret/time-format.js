// You will need to play computer with this example - use the Python Visualiser https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> write your answer here
// pad will be called 3 times, once for totalHours, once for remainingMinutes and once for remainingSeconds.

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
// The value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time is 0 (totalHours).

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
// The return value of pad when it is called for the first time is "00"

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
// The value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program is 1 (remainingSeconds).
// This is because when we call formatTimeDisplay(61), the remainingSeconds is calculated as 61 % 60 which gives us 1

// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
// The return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program is "01".
// This is because pad(1) returns "01" since 1 is padded to 2 digits with leading zeros.

// Predict and explain first...

// const num = 103;

function getLastDigit(num) {
  return num.toString().slice(-1);
}

console.log(`The last digit of 42 is ${getLastDigit(42)}`);
console.log(`The last digit of 105 is ${getLastDigit(105)}`);
console.log(`The last digit of 806 is ${getLastDigit(806)}`);

// This program should tell the user the last digit of each number.
// Explain why getLastDigit is not working properly - correct the problem

// num is declared as a constant variable on ln 3 and all results from then on are based on this value.
// I have changed the function by having num as an argument in the function.

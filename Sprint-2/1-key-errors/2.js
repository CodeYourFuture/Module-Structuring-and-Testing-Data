// Predict and explain first BEFORE you run any code...

// this function should square any number but instead we're going to get an error

// =============> The num should be inside the function square (num) not 3 and square function should be
                 // called later as square(3)

// function square(3) {
//    return num * num;
//}

// =============> function suqare(3) SyntaxError: Unexpected number

// =============> 3 was not expected... instead a declaration or paramater like num was expected.

// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem

// =============> write your new code here

function square(num) {
    return num * num;
}
console.log(square(3))

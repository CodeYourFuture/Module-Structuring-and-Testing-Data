// Predict and explain first BEFORE you run any code...

// this function should square any number but instead we're going to get an error

// =============> There seem to be  no error in the function itself. 
function square(num) {
    return num * num;
}

// =============> . The function square(num) is correctly defined and will work as expected when called with a valid number.

// =============> I ran the code, and no errors occurred. The function square(num) is correctly defined

// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem

// =============> write your new code here

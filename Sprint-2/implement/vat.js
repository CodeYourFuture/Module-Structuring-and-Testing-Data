// If products or services are subject to the 20% standard rate of VAT:
// You must add 20% to the price you charge for the goods or service.
// You can do this by multiplying the price you charge by 1.2.
// For example, if your business sells sports equipment for £50, you multiply £50 by 1.2 for a total VAT inclusive price of £60.

// Implement a function that calculates the new price with VAT (Value Added Tax) added on

// Given a number,
// When I call this function with a number
// it returns the new price with VAT added on



// Define a function named addVAT that takes one parameter: price
function addVAT(price) {

    // Step 1: Calculate the price with VAT by multiplying the price by 1.2
    // (1.2 represents the original price + 20% VAT)
    const priceWithVAT = price * 1.2;

    // 〰️ Step 2: Return the new price with VAT included
    return priceWithVAT;
} 

console.log(addVAT(50)); // Outputs "60"
console.log(addVAT(80)); // Outputs "96"

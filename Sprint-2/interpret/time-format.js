// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// pad will be called three timesâ€”once for each of totalHours, remainingMinutes, and remainingSeconds.

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// The first call to pad is for totalHours, which is 0. So, num is assigned the value 0 during the first call.
// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
//  When pad(0) is called, it returns "00" because padStart(2, "0") ensures the output has two characters.

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// The last call to pad is for remainingSeconds, which is 1. So, num is assigned the value 1 during the last call.
// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// When pad(1) is called, it returns "01" because padStart(2, "0") pads the single digit 1 to make it two characters ("01").

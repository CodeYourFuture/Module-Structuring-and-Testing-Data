// Below are the steps for how BMI is calculated

// The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms (kg) by their height in metres (m) squared.

// For example, if you weigh 70kg (around 11 stone) and are 1.73m (around 5 feet 8 inches) tall, you work out your BMI by:

// squaring your height: 1.73 x 1.73 = 2.99
// dividing 70 by 2.99 = 23.41
// Your result will be displayed to 1 decimal place, for example 23.4.

// You will need to implement a function that calculates the BMI of someone based off their weight and height

// Given someone's weight in kg and height in metres
// Then when we call this function with the weight and height
// It should return their Body Mass Index to 1 decimal place

function calculateBMI(weight, height) {
  let heightSquare = height * height;
  let wheightCal = weight / heightSquare;
  let result1 = wheightCal.toFixed(1);
  //toFixed() returns a string, not a number.
  // need to convert the result to a number
  let tranftoNumber= parseFloat(result1);
  return tranftoNumber;
}

console.log (calculateBMI (56, 1.65))
// return the BMI of someone based off their weight and height

// Below are the steps for how BMI is calculated

// The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms (kg) by their height in metres (m) squared.

// For example, if you weigh 70kg (around 11 stone) and are 1.73m (around 5 feet 8 inches) tall, you work out your BMI by:

// squaring your height: 1.73 x 1.73 = 2.99
// dividing 70 by 2.99 = 23.41
// Your result will be displayed to 1 decimal place, for example 23.4.

// You will need to implement a function that calculates the BMI of someone based off their weight and height

// Given someone's weight in kg and height in metres
// Then when we call this function with the weight and height
// It should return their Body Mass Index to 1 decimal place

function calculateBMI(weight, height) {
  const squaringHeight = height * height;
  const yourBmi = weight / squaringHeight;
  return yourBmi;
}
console.log("Your BMI is :" + calculateBMI(54, 1.54).toFixed(1));
//toFixed() is a method that rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places and returns it as a string.

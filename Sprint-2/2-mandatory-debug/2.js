// Predict and explain first...

// Predict the output of the following code:
// =============> Write your prediction here
/*
const num = 103;

function getLastDigit() {
  return num.toString().slice(-1);
}

console.log(`The last digit of 42 is ${getLastDigit(42)}`);
console.log(`The last digit of 105 is ${getLastDigit(105)}`);
console.log(`The last digit of 806 is ${getLastDigit(806)}`);
*/
// Now run the code and compare the output to your prediction
// =============> write the output here
//The last digit of 42 is 3
//The last digit of 105 is 3
//The last digit of 806 is 3
// Explain why the output is the way it is
// =============> write your explanation here
// the return statement is using the num which is declared as a variable with a value before the function
// because getLastDigit does not have a parameters assigned to it.
// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
// =============> write your new code here

function getLastDigit(num) {
  return num.toString().slice(-1);
}

console.log(`The last digit of 42 is ${getLastDigit(42)}`);
console.log(`The last digit of 105 is ${getLastDigit(105)}`);
console.log(`The last digit of 806 is ${getLastDigit(806)}`);

// This program should tell the user the last digit of each number.
// Explain why getLastDigit is not working properly - correct the problem
// num had already been declared as variable with the value of 103 and not set as the parameter for the function
// so when getLasDigit is called the it draws directly from the variable num

// Predict and explain first...

// =============> write your prediction here
// in console.log we should just write (multiply(10,32) because writing in plain english will give us an error,
// and it won't give the output.

// =============> write your explanation here
// the code was broken because the console.log was inside the function it not a function,
//by using the return it gives us the correct output.

// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
//  =============> write your new code here
function multiply(a, b) {
  return (a * b)
}

console.log(multiply(10, 32));

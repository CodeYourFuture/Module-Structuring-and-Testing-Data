// Predict and explain first...
// function is expected to multiply two numbers and log the result. it starts by taking in args 'a' and 'b', then it logs the product of 'a' and 'b'. 
// then it calls the function with 10 and 32 and tries to log the result of the function call.
// However, the function does not return a value, it only logs the product. Therefore,
// =============> write your prediction here
// undefined
function multiply(a, b) {
  console.log(a * b);
}

console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);

// =============> write your explanation here
// no return in the function so its always undefined
// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
//  =============> write your new code here
/* 
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);

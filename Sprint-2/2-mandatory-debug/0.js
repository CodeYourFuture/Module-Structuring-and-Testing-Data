// Predict and explain first...
// function should multiply a by b and print the answer. and it DOESN'T return .
//  So in the Console.log we don't have the result.

// =============> write your prediction here

// function multiply(a, b) {
//   console.log(a * b);
// }

// console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);

// =============> write your explanation here
// we don't have result for function because there is no return in function . "The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is undefined"

// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
//  =============> write your new code here

function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);

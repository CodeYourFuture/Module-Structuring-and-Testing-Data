// Predict and explain first...

// =============> write your prediction here
// What I predict is that the console.log which is outside the function will pass the parameters 10 and 32 to the function
// Then the console.log(a * b) which is inside the function will print out 
 // to the terminal the multiplication of a by b
function multiply(a, b) {
  const multiplicationResult =  (a * b);
  return multiplicationResult;


  
}

console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);

// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
//  =============> write your new code here

// Predict and explain first...

// =============> write your prediction here
//the function will log the result of multiplying 10 and 32, but it does not return a value from the multiply function, so the output from the placeholder will be undefined.

function multiply(a, b) {
  return (a * b);
}

console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);

// =============> write your explanation here
//the function logged the result of 32 *10 on one line and on the next line it logged the string "The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is undefined" because the multiply function does not return a value.

// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem

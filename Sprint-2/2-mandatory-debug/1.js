// Predict and explain first...
//  =============> write your prediction here
//Here we have return; and => a + b ; in seprate lines closed with semicolon.

/* function sum(a, b) {
  return;
  a + b;
}

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`); */

// =============> write your explanation here
//AS we know that return end and stops the execution of the function witch mean that => a + b
//will not be executed and line 8 is useless since the function stops at line 7.

// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
//  =============> write your new code here


function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);

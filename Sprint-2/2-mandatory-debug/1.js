// Predict and explain first...
//  =============> write your prediction here: There is a semi column on line 5 after the return which separates it from line 6. We don't know what we are returning.

// function sum(a, b) {
//   return;
//   a + b;
// }

// console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);

// =============> write your explanation here: SInce we don't know what we are returning, we will get an undefined value for the function. 
// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
//  =============> write your new code here
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);

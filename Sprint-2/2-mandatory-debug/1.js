// Predict and explain first...
//  =============> write your prediction here : gives the sum of two numbers a and b. but i will not work because a+b is written under the return statement.

// function sum(a, b) {
//   return;
//   a + b;
// }

// console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);

// =============> write your explanation here: The sum of 10 and 32 is undefined because a+b is written under the return statement.
// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
//  =============> write your new code here

// =============> write your explanation here

/*
In JavaScript, when you write return; followed by a line break, it immediately returns undefined.

The line a + b; is never reached due to automatic semicolon insertion after return;.

Therefore, the function returns undefined, and thatâ€™s what gets inserted into the template literal.

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);

//result
//The sum of 10 and 32 is 42

// Predict and explain first...
//  =============> write your prediction here
//In JavaScript, if you write return and then go to a new line, JavaScript will automatically add a semicolon after return. This means the function will return undefined, and the code like a + b on the next line wonâ€™t run at all.




// =============> write your explanation here
//The expression and the return keyword should be in the same line 
// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
//  =============> write your new code here

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
 
}

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);

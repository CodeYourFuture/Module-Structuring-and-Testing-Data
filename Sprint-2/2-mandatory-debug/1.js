// In the function, the return; on line 6 stops the function before it reaches a + b on line 7.
// So nothing is returned â€” that's why the result is undefined.
// When to write return; with a semicolon and put the next line on a new line, the function ends early and ignores everything after it.

// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem

// Predict and explain first...
//  =============> write your prediction here: there is ; error



// =============> write your explanation here: function will be undefined because of ";" by removing ; placing a+b in same line will return function.
// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
//  =============> write your new code here
function sum(a, b) {

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);
//Between "return value" and "function", which one is undefined?

//return value will be undefined if function have not return statement it will automatically returns undefined.

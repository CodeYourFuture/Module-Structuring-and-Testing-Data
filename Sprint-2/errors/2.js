// Predict and explain first...

// this function should square any number but instead we're going to get an error

function square(3) {
    return num * num;
}
// Explanation.
//  First error; Unexpected number
//The function square is defined with 3 as a parameter name, which is not allowed in JavaScript.
//Second error; Inside the function, return num * num; is supposed to square the input number.
//However, thereâ€™s no variable named num defined in this function.
//Fixed  the code:
function square(num) {
    return num * num;
}

console.log(square(3));  // Output: 9

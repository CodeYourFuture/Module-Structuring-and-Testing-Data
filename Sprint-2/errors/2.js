// Predict and explain first...

//This function should square any number but instead, we're going to get an error

function square(3) {
    return num * num;
}

We are going to get an error because one of our goals with our function is to make it reusable and flexible hence we have to use placeholders that will accommodate any number we put in. 
 
Solution: 

function square(x) {


 return num * num;
}

// Predict and explain first...

// this function should square any number but instead we're going to get an error

function square(3) {
    return num * num;
}

/* Functions should not have literal values as the parameters, so writing in the number 3
is not a good parameter.
If instead of 3, the parameter is num, then what would be returned would be num * num.
(Parameters should be used in the function body.)

The console log would call the function while replacing the parameter with a literal value,
for example:
console.log(square(3)); which would return 9

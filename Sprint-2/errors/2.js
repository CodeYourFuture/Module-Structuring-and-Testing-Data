// Predict and explain first...

// this function should square any number but instead we're going to get an error

function square(num) {
    return num * num;
}
console.log(square(3));

// 'num' has not been define. The computer did not know I want 3 as the formula number.
// I should use 'num' inside the function body and put '3' to pass the argument when calling the function

// Predict and explain first...

 function square(num) {
return num * num;

 }
 console.log (square (3))



//The error was with parameter 3, which always gave me the same result. 
// By changing it to "num," the function now works with any number. Also 3 is used as the parameter name for the function, which is not valid in JavaScript.

## 1 Errors

In this section, you need to go to each file in `errors` directory. Read the file and predict what error will happen. Then run the file with node to check what the error is. Your task is to interpret the error message and explain why it occurs. The [errors documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors) will help you figure out the solution.

## 2 Debug

In this section, you need to go to each file in `debug` to **explain and predict** why the program isn't behaving as intended. Then you'll need to run the program with node to check your prediction. You will also need to correct the code too.

## 3 Implement

In this section, you will have a short set of requirements about a function. You will need to implement a function based off this set of requirements. Make sure you check your function works for a number of different inputs.

Here is a recommended order:

1. `1-bmi.js`
1. `2-cases.js`
1. `3-to-pounds.js`

## 4 Interpret

In these tasks, you have to interpret a slightly larger program with some syntax / operators / functions that may be unfamiliar.

You must use documentation to make sense of anything unfamiliar. Learning how to look things up this way is a fundamental part of being a developer!

You can also use `console.log` to check the value of different variables in the code.

## 5 Extend

In the prep for this sprint, we developed a function to convert 24 hour clock times to 12 hour clock times.

Your task is to write tests for as many different groups of input data or edge cases as you can, and fix any bugs you find. This section is not mandatory, but it will also help you solve some similar kata in Codewars.
